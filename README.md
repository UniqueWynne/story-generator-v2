# Story Generator v2

An upgraded interactive Python script that generates multiple personalized mini-stories with random events and saves them to a file. This project demonstrates loops, randomness, user input, file handling, and Python automation skills.

## Description
Story Generator v2 allows users to:
- Generate multiple stories in a single run
- Input names, ages, favorite foods, and favorite colors
- Include randomized events for variety
- Save all stories to a text file (`stories.txt`)

This project builds on the original Story Generator by adding loops, random selection, and file output.

## Features
- Collects user input using Python's `input()`
- Loops to generate multiple stories
- Randomized events for dynamic storytelling
- Saves stories to a file for later viewing
- Prints stories to the terminal

## Skills Demonstrated
- Variables and user input
- Loops (`for` loops)
- Randomization (`random.choice`)
- File handling (`open()` and `write()`)
- F-strings for dynamic text
- Basic automation in Python
